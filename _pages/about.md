### Welcome! üåç

Hello! I'm **Heejun Yoon**, an AI researcher and engineer passionate about advancing AI technologies for real-world impact.
I am currently conducting research at [**Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)**](https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do#secondPage), focusing on AI-driven solutions for Multiview Vision-Language Models.
I earned my **bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering** from [Ewha Womans University](https://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewhaen/index.do).  


#### What Drives Me ‚ú®

Whether it's solving complex problems, exploring cutting-edge technologies, or working on collaborative projects, I‚Äôm always motivated by a love for transforming advanced data insights into meaningful, real-world applications. I‚Äôm particularly interested in:

- **[AI for Social Good]:** Exploring responsible AI technologies, including computer vision and multimodal learning, to tackle global challenges, from biodiversity preservation to equitable resource distribution, driving positive social and ecological impact.
- **[AI for Decision-Making and Policy]:** Leveraging reinforcement learning and data-driven insights to inform policy decisions and optimize complex systems, fostering effective governance and societal benefits.
- **[Explainable, Trustworthy AI]:** Moving beyond black-box, fostering transparency in AI decision-making processes to identify biases, ensure fairness, and promote reliable, trustworthy deployments of responsible and equitable AI systems.

#### The Journey So Far üöÄ

My journey began with a fascination for optimizing complex systems to enhance human life. During my master‚Äôs research, I specialized in **machine vision**, building adaptable and efficient deep learning architectures for inspecting semiconductor products. As an undergraduate, I explored **FMCW radar signal processing** ‚Äì tackling challenges in people counting, motion recognition with 3D point clouds, and vital sign monitoring. These experiences have shaped my drive to push technological boundaries, ensuring that progress remains aligned with sustainability and social good.

#### My Mission üå±

Through my work, I aim to make complex data accessible and actionable and push the boundaries of AI practices. I firmly believe that technology should be developed responsibly and used for the greater good.

If you're curious about my research, upcoming projects, or just want to connect, feel free to contact via [e-mail](mailto:hjyoon9808@gmail.com) or LinkdIn(heejun-yoon).
Looking forward to sharing my work and insights with you!
