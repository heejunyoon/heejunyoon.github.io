### Welcome! 👋

Hello! I'm **Heejun Yoon**, an post-master researcher at the [Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)](https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do#secondPage).

I'm fascinated by the challenge of building intelligent systems that can truly **perceive, understand, and act in our complex world**. My work is about bridging the gap between digital models and physical reality.

I believe technology should be a tool for positive change, and I'm driven to build solutions for real-world impact. I hold M.S. and B.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from [Ewha Womans University](https://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewhaen/index.do).

### 💡 My Current Research

At KIST, I'm focused on developing the core capabilities for intelligent agents. My research is currently centered on two main areas:

* **Multiview Scene Understanding:** How can an AI understand a 3D space from multiple, limited 2D viewpoints? I'm developing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that integrate these views to build a rich, contextual understanding of a scene.
* **Embodied AI (Navigation & Planning):** Taking understanding a step further—how can an agent *act* on that understanding? I'm exploring how Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) can work together for complex task planning and navigation in simulated worlds like Isaac Sim and Omnigibson.

### 🌱 The Questions That Drive Me

My current research builds the 'how'—the technical skills to make an agent see, understand, and act. But my 'why' comes from a deep desire to aim this technology at our planet's most pressing challenges.

I'm fascinated by the gap between standard AI benchmarks and the reality of high-stakes environmental problems. Unlike web-scale data, ecological data is often sparse, geographically biased, and incredibly messy.

This leads me to the core questions I want to tackle in my future work:

* **How do we move beyond "error rates" and measure what truly matters?**
    In manufacturing, the cost of an error is financial. In conservation, the "cost of error" is ecological and human—a habitat we fail to protect, a species lost. How can we build AI evaluation frameworks that measure this true, real-world cost?

* **How can we build a holistic understanding from fragmented data?**
    To understand an ecosystem, we need to connect satellite images, on-the-ground acoustic sensors, and even textual policy reports. How do we build robust models that can fuse these different modalities into a single, reliable picture?

* **How do we create tools that are *useful*, not just *novel*?**
    How can we develop new methods that learn effectively from the limited, imperfect, and label-scarce data that defines real-world problems?

My ultimate goal is to create tools that are not just technically innovative, but are trustworthy, realistic, and truly valuable for the environmental stakeholders, ecologists, and policymakers on the front lines.

### 🚀 My Journey So Far

My path has been a progressive journey of understanding signals and systems.

I started with 1D **radar signals** in undergrad, learning to detect motion and vital signs. My master's research expanded to 2D **machine vision**, where I built models to find tiny defects in semiconductors.

Now, my work at KIST has moved into **3D scenes and embodied action**. This progression—from 1D signals to 2D images, and now to 3D interaction—has given me a powerful toolkit to tackle complex, real-world data.

#### My Mission 🌱

Through my work, I aim to make complex data accessible and actionable and push the boundaries of AI practices. I firmly believe that technology should be developed responsibly and used for the greater good.
