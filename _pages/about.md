### Welcome! 👋

Hello! I'm **Heejun Yoon**, an post-master researcher at the [Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)](https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do#secondPage).

I'm fascinated by the challenge of building intelligent systems that can truly **perceive, understand, and act in our complex world**. My work is about bridging the gap between digital models and physical reality.

I believe technology should be a tool for positive change, and I'm driven to build solutions for real-world impact. I hold M.S. and B.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from [Ewha Womans University](https://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewhaen/index.do).



### 💡 My Current Research

At KIST, I'm focused on developing the core capabilities for intelligent agents. My research is currently centered on two main areas:

* **Multiview Scene Understanding:** How can an AI understand a 3D space from multiple, limited 2D viewpoints? I'm developing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that integrate these views to build a rich, contextual understanding of a scene.
* **Embodied AI (Navigation & Planning):** Taking understanding a step further—how can an agent *act* on that understanding? I'm exploring how Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) can work together for complex task planning and navigation in simulated worlds like Isaac Sim and Omnigibson.

### 🌱 My Research Vision: The Questions That Drive Me

My current research at KIST builds the 'how'—the technical skills to make an agent perceive, understand, and act. But my 'why' comes from a deep desire to aim this technology at our planet's most pressing challenges.

Here is the core problem that fascinates me and the key questions I am preparing to answer.

#### The Core Challenge: AI Beyond Web-Scale Data

Most modern AI excels on standardized benchmarks built from web-scale data. However, these models are often ill-suited for high-stakes environmental problems. Ecological data is the opposite: it's **sparse, expensive to collect, geographically biased** (e.g., most data is from Europe and North America), and incredibly messy.

This is why my focus is on **"Application-Driven AI"**—moving beyond generic benchmarks to build models that solve specific, real-world constraints.

This focus leads me to two fundamental questions:

#### 1. How can we build a unified picture from fragmented data?

To understand an ecosystem, we can't rely on one data type. We must connect satellite images, on-the-ground acoustic sensors, drone footage, and even textual policy reports. Each piece holds a different part of the puzzle.

* **The Question:** How can we build robust **multimodal models** that fuse these diverse, fragmented, and often imperfect data streams into a single, reliable understanding to inform action?

#### 2. How can we optimize decisions when the "cost of error" is real?

In conservation, a model's mistake isn't just a lower accuracy score. It's a habitat we fail to protect, a species lost, or resources wasted on the wrong intervention.

* **The Question:** How can we build **decision-making frameworks** that move beyond simple "error rates"? We need AI that helps policymakers and ecologists prioritize actions, weigh complex trade-offs, and understand the *true* real-world cost of their decisions.

My ultimate goal is to create tools that are not just technically novel, but are trustworthy, realistic, and truly valuable for the stakeholders, scientists, and policymakers on the front lines of conservation and climate change.

### 🚀 My Journey So Far

My path has been a progressive journey of understanding signals and systems.

I started with 1D **radar signals** in undergrad, learning to detect motion and vital signs. My master's research expanded to 2D **machine vision**, where I built models to find tiny defects in semiconductors.

Now, my work at KIST has moved into **3D scenes and embodied action**. This progression—from 1D signals to 2D images, and now to 3D interaction—has given me a powerful toolkit to tackle complex, real-world data.

#### My Mission 🌱

Through my work, I aim to make complex data accessible and actionable and push the boundaries of AI practices. I firmly believe that technology should be developed responsibly and used for the greater good.
