It wasn’t just about helping others understand concepts; it was about learning alongside them and growing together.</p> <h2 id="as-a-teaching-assistant">As a Teaching Assistant…</h2> <h3 id="guiding-in-digital-signal-processing">Guiding in Digital Signal Processing</h3> <p>I still remember the first time I stepped into my role as a <strong>teaching assistant</strong> for the <strong>Digital Signal Processing and Laboratory</strong> course. I was excited, but also nervous. MATLAB was second nature to me by then, but how would I help others grasp it? As the semester progressed, I found joy in guiding students through their <strong>image restoration projects</strong>.</p> <p>It was fascinating to watch them move from struggling with unfamiliar algorithms to confidently implementing <strong>denoising techniques</strong>. I wasn’t just answering their MATLAB and math questions—I was helping them plan and execute their projects. The satisfaction of seeing them succeed made all those hours of preparation and troubleshooting worth it.</p> <h3 id="calculus-a-different-challenge">Calculus: A Different Challenge</h3> <p><strong>Calculus</strong> was a different beast. Over <strong>four semesters</strong>, I delivered <strong>extra lectures</strong>—10 per semester—and helped students tackle problem sets. Teaching abstract mathematical concepts to a room full of varied learning styles was challenging. Yet, every time a student had that “aha” moment, it reminded me why I loved teaching.</p> <hr> <h2 id="as-a-president-of-the-scientific-research-club---ewha-electrical-innovation">As a President of the Scientific Research Club - Ewha Electrical Innovation</h2> <p>Being the <strong>president of our scientific research club</strong> was another chapter in this journey. Our club focused on <strong>robotics</strong>, <strong>deep learning</strong>, and <strong>programming</strong>—all topics close to my heart. Organizing project schedules, providing feedback, and resolving technical challenges became part of my routine.</p> <p>I also enjoyed designing and delivering lectures. <strong>Machine learning</strong>, <strong>Arduino coding</strong>, and even something as specific as <strong>Bluetooth communication</strong> became topics I couldn’t wait to teach. Summers and falls were particularly vibrant, filled with <strong>exhibitions</strong> and collaborative projects. The energy in the club was infectious, and I was proud to be at the helm.</p> <hr> <h2 id="as-a-mentor-in-the-major--a-journey-of-mutual-growth">As a Mentor in the Major… : A Journey of Mutual Growth</h2> <p>Mentorship was perhaps the most rewarding role of all. For <strong>two years</strong>, I worked closely with <strong>freshmen and sophomores</strong>, guiding them through the early, often overwhelming, years of university life. We discussed <strong>study strategies</strong>, project management, and even personal challenges.</p> <p>As the <strong>head mentor</strong>, I had the privilege of designing programs to track progress and ensure effective <strong>mentor-mentee dynamics</strong>. These weren’t one-sided relationships; I often learned as much from my mentees as they did from me. One calculus session stands out vividly—when a student proposed an alternative solution to a problem, it opened my eyes to new teaching methods. Moments like these reminded me that teaching is as much about listening as it is about explaining.</p> <hr> <h2 id="lessons-that-last-a-lifetime">Lessons That Last a Lifetime</h2> <p>Through all these experiences, one thing became clear: <strong>sharing knowledge is a two-way street</strong>. Whether in a classroom, a club meeting, or a quiet one-on-one mentoring session, I found that every interaction offered a chance to learn something new.</p> <p>These roles taught me adaptability. I learned to tailor my explanations to different learning styles and ensure that everyone could grasp the material at their own pace. More importantly, I realized the value of <strong>collective growth</strong>—that the best learning environments are those where everyone feels empowered to contribute and thrive.</p> <hr> <h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2> <p>These experiences have shaped my outlook on life and work. As I move forward, I’m committed to applying this ethos to my research and professional endeavors. Whether I’m developing tools for <strong>environmental monitoring</strong> or mentoring the next generation of researchers, I’ll carry with me the lessons learned from teaching and leading.</p> <p>Technology, when guided by <strong>empathy</strong> and a commitment to <strong>social good</strong>, can drive meaningful change. I’m eager to continue this journey, leveraging my skills and experiences to make a lasting, positive impact.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Heejun Yoon.
